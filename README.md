# broken_dreams

This is a re-creation of the base that Quixadhal started in PykuMUD: https://github.com/quixadhal/PykuMUD

I decided to try and learn from his skeleton, and I want to create my own mudlib here. I started with a bare bones skeleton, getting up to a simple anonymous chatroom.

After that I decided to add his database/alembic setup, and play around with it.

I will re-format the base skeleton and structure to be more original in the future.

More to come..
